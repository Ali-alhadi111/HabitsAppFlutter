## ðŸ“± Add Screenshots (Recommended)

To make your repository look more professional:

1. Take screenshots of your app on your device/emulator
2. Create a folder: `mkdir screenshots` in your project
3. Add your screenshot images to this folder
4. Update README.md to display them
5. Commit and push:
